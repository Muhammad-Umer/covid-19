# Problems
The core problems that are evident at the moment are as follows:
1. General Isolation
2. Food Distributions to Needy People
3. Medicinal Equipment Procurement
4. Quarantine Zones 
5. Medical Consultancy

## General Isolation
The primary way in which the spread of COVID-19 can be prevented is by practicing social isolation as the rate of spread is exponential to the social interactions happening. Given the general trend that is being observed right now, it is quite difficult to make people agree on doing this.

## Food Distribution To Needy People
It is evident that a lot of people could suffer from extreme hunger as the country has a lot of people working on daily wages. With the possibility of lockdown looming around, these people could suffer the worst fate if not dealt properly.

## Medicinal Equipment Procurement
Given the sharp rise in cases throughout the country, the medical facilities are now short of necessary equipment required to operate optimally. It has been identified that a lot of doctors don’t have the necessary equipment to perform their jobs which pose a greater risk as they might become infected as well.

## Quarantine Zones
With a sharp rise in the cases, it is a high possibility that a lot of the people might have to be placed in quarantine. With limited capacity in the hospitals and the lack of infrastructure in the country, this can bring the system to a standstill.

## Medical Consultancy
Given the hysteria around the disease, a lot of people might be requiring medical consultancy for the symptoms of COVID-19. It needs to be ensured that people are getting required medical support even in the worst times.
