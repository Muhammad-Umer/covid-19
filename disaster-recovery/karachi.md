# Disaster Recovery Plan (Karachi)

## 1. Introduction
Karachi is the largest city of Pakistan and the most populated, which makes
it extremely difficult to manage in a crisis situation.

Because it has been growing rapidly, it does not have an actual center
which makes co-ordination a challenge. 

This document would serve as a guideline for disaster recovery for COVID-19
and would cater various aspects. 

## 2. Demographics

In this section, we will not cover the general demographics, but in the light 
of COVID-19 disaster and how should one look at Karachi when solving for this catastrophe

Karachi should be divided into 3 parts 
1) Main Karachi 
2) Edge Karachi
3) Crisis Karachi

or simply ***MEC (Main, Edge, Crisis)***.

#### 2.3. Explanation of the Division and Sub Division
#### 2.3.1. Crisis Karachi
All the area that is between Geo Shinwari and Bahria Town 
located on motorway M-9 is considered to be a part of crisis Karachi.
The main road artery joining rest of Karachi with this part is M-9 
Motorway. It should cover the 30km length and 2km width area
along the M-9 motorway.

## 3. Strategy
#### 3.1. Severity Levels
There should be four severity levels in this system
1) ***Sev 0*** (Highlighted in Red) - ![#FF0000](https://placehold.it/15/FF0000/000000?text=+)
2) ***Sev 1*** (Highlighted in Orange) - ![#FFA500](https://placehold.it/15/FFA500/000000?text=+)
3) ***Sev 2*** (Highlighted in Yellow) - ![#FFFF00](https://placehold.it/15/FFFF00/000000?text=+)
4) ***Sev 3*** (Highlighted in Green) - ![#00FF00](https://placehold.it/15/00FF00/000000?text=+)

- **SEV 0 => Critically ill**
- **SEV 1 => Seriously ill**
- **SEV 2 => Moderately ill**
- **SEV 3 => Mildly ill or no symptoms**

The transition between severity levels is shown in the diagram below:

#### 3.2. Ambulance queuing mechanism
##### 3.2.1 District Level Distribution
1) Each district would have a dedicated pool.
2) Each district would have dedicated queues (can be multiple)
3) Each district should have operators dedicated to the same area users
4) All operators should be able to contact centralized dispatcher
5) Centralized dispatcher
   1) Dispatches ambulances to users from queues
   2) Contact central pool if district pool becomes small
   3) Direct ambulances from pool to queues
   
![Alt text](../images/amb-district.png?raw=true "Title")

##### 3.2.2 Overall distribution
1) Total 5 district pools and 1 central pool
2) Central pool has a team in contact with dispatchers from districts
3) Central team dispatches ambulances from central to district pools

![Alt text](../images/pool-dist.png?raw=true "Title")

##### 3.2.3 Central Pool
1) Central pool is filled by three different levels
   1) Level 1 (Welfare Organizations + Government)
   2) Level 2 (Ride-share Organizations)
   3) Level 3 (Hospitals)
2) Central pool should be filled by the levels in ascending order.
(Hospitals should be the last resort).
3) A higher level (level 2) should only be contacted if a lower level
(level 1) is out of capacity
4) Centralized dispatch team should be able to contact representatives
from each level.

1) 1 million PKR **OR**
