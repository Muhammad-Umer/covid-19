# Disaster Recovery Plan (Karachi)

## 1. Introduction
Karachi is the largest city of Pakistan and the most populated, which makes
it extremely difficult to manage in a crisis situation.

Because it has been growing rapidly, it does not have an actual center
which makes co-ordination a challenge. 

This document would serve as a guideline for disaster recovery for COVID-19
and would cater various aspects. 

## 2. Demographics

In this section, we will not cover the general demographics, but in the light 
of COVID-19 disaster and how should one look at Karachi when solving for this catastrophe

Karachi should be divided into 3 parts 
1) Main Karachi 
2) Edge Karachi
3) Crisis Karachi

or simply ***MEC (Main, Edge, Crisis)***.

#### 2.3.1. Crisis Karachi
All the area that is between Geo Shinwari and Bahria Town 
located on motorway M-9 is considered to be a part of crisis Karachi.
The main road artery joining rest of Karachi with this part is M-9 
Motorway. It should cover the 30km length and 2km width area
along the M-9 motorway.

## 3. Strategy
#### 3.1. Severity Levels
There should be four severity levels in this system
1) ***Sev 0*** (Highlighted in Red) - ![#FF0000](https://placehold.it/15/FF0000/000000?text=+)
2) ***Sev 1*** (Highlighted in Orange) - ![#FFA500](https://placehold.it/15/FFA500/000000?text=+)
3) ***Sev 2*** (Highlighted in Yellow) - ![#FFFF00](https://placehold.it/15/FFFF00/000000?text=+)
4) ***Sev 3*** (Highlighted in Green) - ![#00FF00](https://placehold.it/15/00FF00/000000?text=+)

- **SEV 0 => Critically ill**
- **SEV 1 => Seriously ill**
- **SEV 2 => Moderately ill**
- **SEV 3 => Mildly ill or no symptoms**
